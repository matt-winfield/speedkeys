# speedkeys

A typing speed trainer and testing website.

# Why?

Most typing websites just choose random words - This website aims to improve
your typing speed by analysing which keys you are slowest at typing, and
focusing on words containing those letters.

This forces you to practice the letters you are weakest at more often.

There is also a normal test mode that does not prioritise your weakest keys, for
a fair comparison of actual WPM.
